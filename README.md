Creating a complete Billing, Buying, Booking, Finance, and Tracking application involves a significant amount of code and design work, which is beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide you with a basic outline and examples for each component. Keep in mind that this is a simplified version and you would need to expand and optimize it for a real-world application.

1. Setting up the Database
You'll first need to create a MySQL database to store information. Below is a basic schema example:

2. PHP Code
a. Customer Management
b. Product Management
c. Ordering and Finance

3. HTML Forms
You would need HTML forms for adding customers, products, and placing orders.

4. Additional Features
You can expand this application by adding features like authentication, tracking orders, generating invoices, reporting, etc. This would require a more complex code structure and possibly a framework for better organization.

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point and a real-world application would need much more robust error handling, security measures, and optimizations.
